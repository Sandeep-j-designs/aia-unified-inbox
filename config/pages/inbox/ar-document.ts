/**
 * What the inbox hands the AR sheet, for one row of an upload batch.
 *
 * The difference from AP is not in this file's shape — it is the same document
 * the sheet reads either way — but in where the values come from and what is
 * missing. An AP bill is *read off* a supplier's paper, so the extraction has
 * an opinion about every line. An AR row came out of the customer's own
 * spreadsheet: it carries a customer, a number, a date, a state, a ledger and
 * an amount, and nothing else. There is no source document behind it, so there
 * is no printed HSN and no supplier classification to reconcile against.
 *
 * That is the whole of "AR is the same as AP with a little context change":
 * one line, no printed codes, and the party is who we billed.
 *
 * DEV: replace with GET /api/inbox/:id/rows/:index/document.
