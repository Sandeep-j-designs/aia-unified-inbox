 * the two prototypes cannot drift into offering different ledgers for the same
 * entry.
 *
 * GST registrations are NOT here. The Inbox already knows a company's branches
 * (see `companies` in components/inbox/v2/store), the list has a GST
 * Registration column reading off them, and the bulk Reassign panel writes to
 * them. A second source of branches would be a second answer to the same
 * question.
 *
 * DEV: in production these are three master endpoints —
 *   GET /api/ledgers              → LedgerAccount[]
 *   GET /api/cost-centre-classes  → CostCentreClass[]
 *   GET /api/cost-centres         → CostCentre[]
 * Replace this file and nothing else; every picker reads through it.
