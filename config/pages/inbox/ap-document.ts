 * What the inbox hands the AP sheet.
 *
 * The AP prototype's extraction takes a document, not a filled-in voucher: a
 * supplier as printed, an invoice number, a date, and lines carrying what the
 * supplier wrote. It matches the vendor itself, proposes the masters the book
 * is missing, infers the codes, and works out GST and TDS. So the inbox hands
 * over the *document* and lets that pipeline run, rather than pre-deciding any
 * of it — which is the whole reason for embedding the sheet instead of
 * rebuilding it.
 *
 * The shape here is the AP file's `SAMPLE`. Anything omitted falls back to that
 * object's own value on the other side.
 *
 * DEV: replace with the extraction payload from GET /api/inbox/:id/document.
 * The field names are already the ones the AP sheet reads.
