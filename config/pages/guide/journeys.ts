/**
 * The journeys the Guide button offers.
 *
 * Inbox leads because it is the new one and the only one scripted here — the
 * other four are production's existing journeys, carried so the launcher reads
 * as the same dialog a user already knows. Their `complete` flags are the
 * seeded state of an account that has been through onboarding.
 *
 * DEV: replace with the guide service's journey list for the signed-in user.
 * Completion comes back per journey; nothing here is client-derived.
