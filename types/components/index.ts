/**
 * PROTOTYPE SUBSET of types/components/index.ts in aiaccountant-app.
 *
 * Production's version is large and pulls in feature contracts from
 * types/pages/, config/ and schemas/. Only the types the template's own
 * components need are reproduced here, VERBATIM, so a component written against
 * them compiles unchanged in production.
 *
 * Need another type from that file? Copy it in here verbatim — do not redefine
 * it with a different shape.
