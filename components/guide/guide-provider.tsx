    The two ways a step ends without Next.

    A click is taken on the capture phase and from the whole subtree of the
    anchor — the highlighted control is usually a button with an icon and a
    label inside it, and the click that matters may land on either. Advancing
    is deferred a frame so the screen the click causes is already up when the
    next step measures its anchor.

    A wait is a poll, guarded by whether the element was already there when the
    step opened: the same tour runs on an empty Inbox and on a full one, and
    on a full one the row it is waiting for exists before the upload it is
    waiting on has happened.
