 * table, same totals panel, same imbalance banner. What is dropped is the
 * page's own chrome: that screen owns its title and its Discard / Save Voucher
 * pair, and here the Inbox's header already holds Delete and Approve & Next,
 * which are the same two decisions under the names this queue gives them.
 *
 * Composition only. Every rule lives in the store, beside the rules for the
 * other two routes:
 *   - `journalTotals`     the two column totals and whether they agree
 *   - `journalLineErrors` the lines that cannot post, and why
 *   - `issue`             whether this voucher may be approved at all
 *
 * DEV: on transplant this directory moves as-is and the three imports above
 * resolve to the journal-voucher service. The form model is the Inbox's shared
 * `Form`, so the seam is the mapping in the store, not these components.
