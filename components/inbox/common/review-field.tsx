/**
 * One field on a review surface. Ported from APField in js/native-ap.jsx.
 *
 * The verification mechanic is the important part: a field the classifier was
 * unsure about is outlined, carries "Low confidence — please verify", and does
 * not clear until the accountant focuses or edits it. Approve stays disabled
 * until every flagged field has been touched.
 *
 * That is deliberately a *touch*, not a correction — the accountant is being
 * asked to look, not to retype something that was probably right. Auto-clearing
 * the warning would defeat the point, and blocking on an edit would make them
 * fake one.
