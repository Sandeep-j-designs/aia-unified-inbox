/**
 * The bills review sheet, mounted into the inbox's OWN document.
 *
 * It used to be an <iframe>. The sheet carries ten <dialog>s, and a dialog
 * opened with showModal() renders in the top layer of its own document — inside
 * an iframe that is the iframe's box, so "Create Vendor" was centred on the
 * frame, clipped by it, and could not overlay the inbox's header or footer.
 * In this document the same dialog centres on the viewport and covers the page.
 *
 * The three assets come from scripts/build-ap-sheet.cjs, which splits
 * public/ap/index.html — still the source of truth, still opens standalone:
 *
 *   sheet.css   the sheet's CSS with every selector scoped under .ap-sheet, so
 *               its `:root` tokens and `body` ground cannot reach the app's
 *   sheet.html  the markup, injected as-is
 *   sheet.js    the engine, wrapped in one function scope per evaluation
 *
 * DEV: on transplant this is the seam to replace. Production should render the
 * bill form as React components against the same endpoints; this keeps the
 * shipped AP sheet byte-identical in the meantime, which no hand-port of an
 * 11k-line engine could promise.

      Opening a bill evaluates the engine, and an evaluation cannot be undone:
      removing the <script> element below drops the tag, not the listeners it
      registered on window and document. Paging through bills therefore left
      one live engine per bill, all bound to the same ids in the same document,
      and every one of them answered the next seed — a new bill raised one
      toast per bill previously opened, which is what read as notifications
      firing at random.

      The engine's integration block reads this and stands down when it no
      longer matches, so only the newest evaluation drives the sheet. It stands
      the AR engines down too; see ./sheet-generation.
