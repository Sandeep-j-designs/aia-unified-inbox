 * The sales invoice sheet, mounted into the inbox's OWN document.
 *
 * The AP sheet's twin — see components/inbox/v2/ap-sheet.tsx for why this is
 * not an <iframe>: both sheets carry <dialog>s opened with showModal(), and a
 * modal dialog renders in the top layer of its own document, which inside a
 * frame is the frame's box.
 *
 * The three assets come from scripts/build-ar-sheet.cjs, which splits
 * public/ar/index.html — still the source of truth, still opens standalone:
 *
 *   sheet.css   the sheet's CSS with every selector scoped under .ar-sheet, so
 *               its `:root` tokens and `body` ground cannot reach the app's
 *   sheet.html  the markup, injected as-is
 *   sheet.js    the engine, wrapped in one function scope per evaluation
 *
 * DEV: on transplant this is the seam to replace. Production should render the
 * invoice form as React components against the same endpoints; this keeps the
 * shipped AR sheet byte-identical in the meantime.
