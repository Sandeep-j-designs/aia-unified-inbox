 *
 * One loop instead, holding its own position and retargeting every frame. New
 * rows move the target; they do not restart anything, so the motion carries
 * its speed across arrivals and reads as a single drift. The smoothing is
 * exponential and scaled by real elapsed time, so it behaves the same on a
 * 120Hz display as on a 60Hz one, and it self-terminates when it lands.
