                    Three layouts, and which one a route gets is decided by one
                    thing: whether its sheet draws the source document itself.

                    AP hands the whole width to its sheet, which is already a
                    document-beside-form split with its own splitter. Wrapping
                    it in a second split was what halved the form and tripped
                    its container query into folding every field into one
                    column.

                    AR's sheet has no document pane — standalone, an invoice is
                    raised rather than read off paper — but an inbox item always
                    has a file behind it, so the inbox supplies the preview and
                    the sheet takes the rest. Resizable rather than fixed,
                    because the invoice's Item Details table is 1702px of
                    columns and no fixed share is going to seat it.

                    JV uses the journal prototype beside a resizable source preview.
                    Its fields respond to the available pane width.

                    This is the rule hooks/pages/inbox/use-inbox-detail.ts
                    already encodes as `isTwoPane`; that module drives
                    components/inbox/detail, which this workspace replaced.

                    Failures, sorted by what fixes them.

                    A retry fixes an interrupted upload; nothing but a new file
                    fixes a password-protected or damaged one. So the rows split
                    into those two groups, each with its own action, and Retry
                    all belongs to the first group only — it never offers to fix
                    what it cannot. When every failure is the same kind there is
                    one group, and the headings go: the panel header says the
                    reason once.

    Reviewing one document drops the SIDEBAR but keeps the top bar. The review
    surface is a document beside a form that the accountant resizes, and the
    sidebar's width was taken from the half they were reading — but the bar is
    50px and it is where Sync lives, and a sync is not a property of the screen
    you happen to be on. Losing the control the moment you opened a document
    meant you had to navigate away from your work to start one.

    The chevron at the head of the header row is still the way back; the bar
    adds no second navigation, it carries the app-level actions.

    Deciding this here rather than inside SidebarLayout is deliberate — that
    component is a stub mirroring production's props contract and is deleted at
    handoff, so it must not grow a prop production does not have.
