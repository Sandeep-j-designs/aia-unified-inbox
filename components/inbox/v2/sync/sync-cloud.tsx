/**
 * The cloud beside a document's name — whether Tally has it yet.
 *
 * One glyph, coloured by state, as in the design: amber while the document is
 * in a run or carrying an edit Tally has not seen, muted once it has landed or
 * if it has never gone. It is a passive marker, so it never takes focus or a
 * click; the tooltip exists because "why is this one amber" is the only
 * question it raises.
 *
 * There is no re-sync: a voucher edited after posting simply becomes syncable
 * again, and goes across on the next ordinary run. The tooltip says so rather
 * than offering an action that does not exist.
 *
 * Built from Figma 25082:19760.
