/**
 * The inbox's half of the AR protocol — the mirror of ./sheet.tsx, which does
 * the same job for the bills sheet.
 *
 * Both sheets run in this document rather than in an iframe, so both ends of
 * the protocol are this window. It still goes over postMessage: each sheet's
 * half is written against `parent`, which is `window` when there is no frame,
 * and both guards still hold — ev.source is this window and the origin is our
 * own. Keeping the message boundary also keeps the seam honest, since the
 * engines remain separate units from the React tree.
 *
 * The one thing to know about the pairing: AP answers on `aia-ap` / `aia-ap-v2`
 * and AR on `aia-ar` / `aia-ar-v2`. Two sheets can be alive in the same
 * document while a route switch settles, and a shared source name would have
 * the bill's snapshot landing on the invoice's item.
