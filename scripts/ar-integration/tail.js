/* ============================================================================
   EMBED MODE — this sheet, hosted inside the Unified Inbox
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The inbox already supplies the furniture around a sales invoice: the source
   document on the left, the title and the cohort pager above, and Convert /
   Delete / Save draft / Approve & Next below. So when this file is loaded with
   ?embed=1 it drops its own topbar and renders the sheet alone, and the two
   halves talk over postMessage.

   Nothing above this block knows it is embedded. Opening index.html directly
   behaves exactly as it did — this is additive, and the guard is the first
   line of it.

   The shape is the AP sheet's, deliberately: two sheets in one inbox that
   answer different protocols would be two things to remember. What differs is
   what the two sheets are, and there is one difference worth naming here.

   The AP sheet owns a document pane, because a bill is *read off* a supplier's
   paper. This one has none — standalone, an invoice is raised rather than read,
   and the form is the whole workspace. Under the inbox there IS a source
   document, so the inbox keeps its own preview beside the sheet and the sheet
   stays what it is. That is why there is no `preview` message here and no
   `--topbar-h` sticky-offset fix for a pane that does not exist.

   The inbox sends:
     seed       {customerName, invoiceNo, invoiceDate, lines, …} — a SAMPLE-
                shaped document; the real extraction pipeline runs on it, so
                every prediction, HSN call and threshold test is the same one
                the standalone sheet makes.
     approve    press Create Invoice
     saveDraft  hold the draft against this inbox item
     discard    press Discard

   This sheet sends back:
     ready      the sheet is up and listening
     totals     after every render, so the inbox header can show the figure
     dirty      something was edited — the inbox marks the item unsaved
     approved   the invoice was created

     replacement. This sheet's sample is a *demonstration* — it carries a
     customer PO number, a consignee, a delivery note, a narration about a
     desktop refresh — and an inbox invoice supplies none of those. Spread, they
     survive: the screen printed PO/ANV/2026/0442 on an oil invoice from a
     customer who never raised it, which is an invented fact on a voucher about
     to be posted.

     So only three values carry over, and each because it is the company's

     a sale, and the sales ledger it posts to when the customer master names
